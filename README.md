# Puzzle-Game-Project

Puzzle-Game-Project is coded in Assembly for the Z80 processor. Excluding the music driver, all code is written from scratch by Henry Church.<br>
The game involves walking on walls and pushing blocks on a 2-D grid in order to reach a destination.<br>
WIP. Can be played by loading ROM iawb.gb (found in 'build' directory) on 'bgb' emulator (https://bgb.bircd.org/).<br>
