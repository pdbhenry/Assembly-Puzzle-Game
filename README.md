# Assembly-Puzzle-Game

Assembly-Puzzle-Game is coded in Assembly for the Z80 processor. Excluding the music driver (hUGEDriver), all code is written from scratch by Henry Church.<br><br>
The game involves walking on walls and pushing blocks on a 2-D grid in order to reach a destination.<br><br>
WIP. Can be played by loading ROM iawb.gb (found in 'build' directory) on 'bgb' emulator (https://bgb.bircd.org/).<br><br>
