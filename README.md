# Puzzle-Game-Project

Puzzle-Game-Project is coded in Assembly for the Z80 processor.
Excluding the music driver, all code is written from scratch by Henry Church.
The game involves walking on walls and pushing blocks on a 2-D grid in order to reach a destination.
WIP. Can be played by loading ROM iawb.gb (found in 'build' directory) on 'bgb' emulator (https://bgb.bircd.org/).
